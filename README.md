# Note-Taker

This program is a Note Taker that helps you take notes if you need it for anything in everyday life.

Here is the screen that welcomes you to the page

This is how the page looks once you create a few notes. The option to create something new will lie on the top right of the screen. At any time you may also delete the previous notes to clear up space with the red trash icon on the left
